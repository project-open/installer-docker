]project-open[ V5.2 Docker

This is the only "official" installer now for ]project-open[.
We also provide a VMware virtual machine, but that's just this
same installer on top of a VM that runs docker.

Base of the installer is a docker image created by Gustaf Neumann
with a base installation of Naviserver and designed to run OpenACS.
